Ride Sharing Observations:

1. There is a directly proprtional relationship between the number of people who use ride sharing and the population of that city.
2. People in smaller towns tend to travel further distances, thus increasing the total price for the fares.
3. People in cities tend to pay the least amount when traveling, but the frequency ends up making it the most profitable.
